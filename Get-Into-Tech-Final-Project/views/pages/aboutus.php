<h1>About Us:</h1>

We are doing this final event blog project for our course ‘GET INTO TECH WITH SKY’. 
</p>
<p>
    We all come from different and diverse backgrounds  with a common mission and interest which is becoming a website developer. We have designed this blog for people looking to see any upcoming events taking place in London. It is a site where you can see what is happening and where, presenting events from musical events, to movies, theatrical events  & tourist attractions. </p>
    
    <p>It also has the links to the relevant venue / attraction websites where you can purchase tickets. We designed a online form where users  suggest us any happening place or event and we can add to our database.
